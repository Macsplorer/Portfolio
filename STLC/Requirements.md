# Folder: New Features & Critical Testing Questions

---

## 1. Product Rating System

**Requirement:**  
Users should be able to rate products with a 5-star system and add written feedback.

### Critical Testing Questions

- Can all users (logged-in and guest) see the product ratings and reviews?
- Is the rating feature restricted to only users who have purchased the product?
- What happens if a user submits an empty review or only a star rating without written feedback—does the system handle this gracefully?

## 2. Age Verification for Alcoholic Products

**Requirement:**  
A modal should appear asking if the user is 18+ before accessing alcoholic products.

### Critical Testing Questions

- Does the age verification modal appear every time a user tries to access alcoholic products, or is it shown only once per session?
- What happens if a user enters an invalid age (e.g., letters, empty field, or age under 18)?
- Can the user bypass the modal through the browser’s back button, refresh, or other navigation tricks?

## 3. Shipping Cost Changes

**Requirement:**  
Orders above a certain amount get free shipping, while others incur a fee.

### Critical Testing Questions

- Is the shipping cost correctly calculated and updated in real-time as users add/remove products from the cart?
- Is the threshold amount for free shipping clearly displayed to the user during the checkout process?
- Are edge cases handled correctly—for example, what happens if the total is exactly at the free shipping threshold?
